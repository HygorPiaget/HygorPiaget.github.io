I graduated in Physics from the Federal University of Ceará (2009), where I also obtained my Master's degree in Physics in 2011 and my Ph.D. in 2016. I am currently a Professor at the Federal Institute of Ceará on the [Acaraú](http://www.ifce.edu.br/acarau) campus. My main areas of activity are Genetic Algorithm, Laws of scale and allometry of cities, Elections and Economy.

I live with my wife Marianna and our dog Lola. I have a great interest in politics, which of course has already given me innumerable enmities. I'm a great video expert on YouTube, and a compusive procastinor in treatment.
