I graduated in Physics from the Federal University of Ceará (2009), where I also obtained my Master's degree in Physics in 2011 and my Ph.D. in 2016. I am currently a Assistant Professor and local Director of Research and Innovation at the Federal Institute of Ceará on the [Acaraú](http://www.ifce.edu.br/acarau) campus. My main areas of interest are Statistical Mechanics and Computational Social Science. 
I am currently focused on the impact of money invested on the political campaign by the candidates and the final result of the election.

I live with my wife Marianna and our dog Lola. I have a great interest in politics, which of course has already given me 
numerous problems. I'm a great YouTube video expert, and a compulsive procrastinator in treatment.
