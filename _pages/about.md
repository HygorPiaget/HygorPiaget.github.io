I graduated in Physics from the Federal University of Ceará (2009), where I also obtained my Master's degree in Physics in 2011 and my Ph.D. in 2016. After three years as a postdoctoral researcher at CFTC in Lisbon, I am now a senior researcher at [CREF](https://cref.it/en/team/32-hygor-piaget-2/) in Rome, working to characterize the relationship between economic complexity and mobility within cities. My main areas of interest are non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and computational social science.

I am currently investigating the impact of money invested on political campaigns by the candidates on the final result of the election.-->

I live with my wife Marianna and our dog Lola. I have a great interest in politics, which of course has already caused me 
countless problems. I'm also a great YouTube video expert.
