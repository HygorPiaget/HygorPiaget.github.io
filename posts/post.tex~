primeiro explicar motivacao


resolver o caso simples de uma reta [0,1] com [0,0.5] de uma cor 
e mostrar que a probabilidade melhora a medida que o prof vai mais 
vezes olhar. Mas o erro decresce com 1/N^0.5, o que e muito lento. 
Sera que existe metodo melhor?

segunda parte, ao invez de olhar varias vezes em um dia, o professor decide 
olhar varios dias apenas uma vez. Desse jeito é melhor? esse caso é o anterios 
mas com replecement. Igual a colocar novamente a bola no saco.



I have studied the manuscript "Clout, Activists and Budget: The Road to Presidency" by Lucas Böttcher
and coauthors. Here the authors propose a new model where the complex interplay between activistis, 
political clout, and campaign costs are used in order to explain the campaign result. They start 
by defing the model for a complex network and then derive the equations for a mean-field approximation.
The authors studied the role of each parameter and finaly apply the model for the pool data of the US 
presidential election 2016.  

In summary, I find the results very interesting, and I believe that this paper can be published if the authors consider the following comments.

1) In page 3 I would like to see a reference about the statement: "Money matters in campaigns. The 
benefit of campaign expenditures is positive, but typically low and subject to rapid decay."

2) In page 4 I believe that in the definitions of the fractions $a$, $b$, and $o$ the latters 
$A$, $B$, and $O$ should be $N$.

3) The authors used a random regular network with fixed degree. I wonder ...


4) I like the model but my main criticism of the manuscript is about the application of the model on real elections.
 
	4.1) A large fraction of the literature of statistical mechanics is applied at legislative 
			 elections. I wonder how to apply the authors model for a election with a large number of 
       candidates. Even for a thirt party candidate I don't see a simple way to find the entire 
			 number of parameters required by the model.   

  4.2) The authors claim that the model could explain the 2016 US presidencial election. 
				More precisely they claim that the Trump election was a consequence of a high convincing 
				probability ($\rho_B > \rho_A$). At this point I ask the author to please let clear the 
				value of $\rho_B$ at the main text and in Fig. 5 caption, I only find at Fig. 4 caption.  
				This is a strong claim, unfortunatly the nice agrement with the election in Fig. 5 is 
				only obtened by heuristicaly ajusting the unique parameter that can not be measuramed.

	4.3) I wonder the real importance of three parameters. It seems that the convincing probability
				$\rho$ can be interchanged by the activistis. The model validation seems to be quite sencible 
			 for changes in the parameters values, so how can the authors suport the choose of $a^{+}=0.175$
			 and $b^{+}=0.1$ since there is a believe that the Trump supporters were not captured by 
			the polls, that why they call theyselfs "the silence majority". I would like to see 
			if the authors can get the same result of Fig. 5 keeping the convincing probabilities 
			the same for both candidates, but now changing $a^+$ and $b^+$.
