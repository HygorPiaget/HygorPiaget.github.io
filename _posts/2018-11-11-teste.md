Supose a game for two players, were you recieve 80$ and the other player 20$. 
The objective is simple -- You have 100 chocolate bars to buy and you want to buy as much 
as possible more than your friend. But there is three rules to buy:

1. Each time step both players needs to try to buy one chocolate bar, and you have to play until you spend your money totally. 

2. In order to try to buy one chocolate bar you need to spend $$\Delta m$$. 

3. You can't choose the chocolate bar. You can only pick one randomly in each time step and 
if that bar was already choosed before, by you or your opponent, you lose your $$\Delta m$$.

Since you have much more money than your opponent, you probably will be able to buy more chocolate
than him. Is this true no matter $$\Delta m$$? The naive reasoning let you believe that in the end of the game,
if you sum the total amount of chocolates bought 80% will be yours and only 20% will stay for your friend.
